          knowledgeable and professional and was able to provide us with the guidance we needed to prepare and
          stage our condo as well as price it to sell. She went above and beyond and was able to recommend
          external services to help prepare everything. She also made her herself available 24/7 in order to
          answer our questions, run errands for us and work around our schedules. On top of that, she is a
          very positive, kind and supportive person and agent who is a delight to work with. Would highly
